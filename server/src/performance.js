// Engagement scoring service — counts each person's scoring actions straight out
// of tasks / task_comments and turns them into points. The policy (what an action
// is worth) lives in scoring.js; this file is the DB-facing glue.
//
// Nothing is persisted: a point is a row that already exists in one of those
// tables, so the leaderboard is always live and there is no job to run, no cache
// to invalidate and no history to rebuild. Completing a task updates the board on
// the next read — including retroactively, since removing a scoring rule changes
// every past score too.
//
// Day boundaries are UTC (substr(iso,1,10)) to match the dashboards.
