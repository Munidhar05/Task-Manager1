// Audio / video / screen-share calling.
//
// The media is peer-to-peer WebRTC in a full mesh: every participant holds one
// RTCPeerConnection per other participant. A mesh is the right shape for the
// team-sized calls this app is for — it needs no media server at all, where an
// SFU would mean another deployed service and a per-stream bandwidth bill. The
// cost is that each person uploads their camera once per peer, so this stays
// good to roughly five or six people and is not trying to be a webinar tool.
//
// Mounted once in App's Layout, NOT inside the Chats page, and it opens its own
// WebSocket: a call has to be answerable while you are on Tasks or Meetings, and
// it has to survive navigating between them. The hub keeps a Set of sockets per
// user, so this second connection sits happily alongside the Chats page's own.
//
// Signalling rule that keeps it simple: THE JOINER ALWAYS OFFERS. Whoever picks
// up sends an offer to everyone already in the call, so for any pair exactly one
// side initiates and there is no glare to resolve.
//
// RINGING. A ring is not "a message that arrived once". It used to be — the
// socket said "call-ring", the card went up, and only Answer or Decline took it
// down — so a ring outlived its call: answered on another tab, hung up by the
// caller, or simply never answered, the card stayed until someone pressed
// Decline, the next day, on a call long over (and pressing Answer instead put
// them into it). Now a ring ends when the server says so (call-ring-stop,
// call-ended), when its time is up, and whenever this device comes back
// (reconnect, tab shown, app resumed) and asks what is actually ringing. The
// server also pushes every ring to the callee's phones, where the app's native
// layer rings like a phone call (lib/nativeCall.ts).

// Public STUN only. It gets a direct path on ordinary home and office networks;
// symmetric NAT (some corporate firewalls, a few mobile carriers) needs a TURN
// relay, which is a server we would have to run and pay for. When that happens
// the connection reports 'failed' and we say so rather than showing a dead frame.
